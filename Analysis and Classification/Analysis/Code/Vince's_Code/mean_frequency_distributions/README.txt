These are mean frequency distributions for the fragmented data. The FT 
was taken for each 200-point time-contiguous data chunk. The mean of 
these was taken, and displayed.

The horizontal lines represent integral multiples of the standard 
deviation for the mean distribution. I added them just to see what 
they looked like.
